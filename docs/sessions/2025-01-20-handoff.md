# Session Handoff - 2025-01-20

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Main Task: E2E Testing Implementation âœ…
Created comprehensive E2E test suite for Cowpilot MCP server with:
- MCP Inspector-based tests (high-level)
- Raw SSE/JSON-RPC tests using curl+jq (low-level)
- Full integration with build system (Makefile targets)
- CI/CD pipeline template
- Extensive documentation

### Key Learning: RTFM Incident ðŸ“š
- Initially implemented wrong CLI syntax for MCP Inspector
- User pointed out the error (hadn't read the docs properly)
- Successfully corrected all implementations
- Added raw SSE testing approach from blog as bonus

### Files Created/Modified: 16 total
- Test scripts: 5 files
- Documentation: 6 files  
- Integration: 2 files (Makefile, CI workflow)
- Helper scripts: 3 files

### Testing Now Available
```bash
make e2e-test-prod    # Test against production
make e2e-test-raw     # Raw protocol tests
make e2e-test-local   # Test local server
```

## Current Server Status
- **Production**: https://cowpilot.fly.dev/ âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Protocol**: MCP v2025-03-26 over SSE
- **Tools**: "hello" tool returning "Hello, World!"
- **Tests**: All passing in both test suites

## Ready for Next Session
1. **Add More Tools**: Server structure ready for expansion
2. **Add Auth**: No authentication currently implemented
3. **Add Resources/Prompts**: Infrastructure ready, not implemented
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Can add metrics endpoint
5. **Load Testing**: Can build on raw SSE test approach

## Important Context for Next Session
- STATE.yaml has been updated to v4.0 with optimized structure
- Dual testing approach established (Inspector + raw)
- All scripts are executable and documented
- SSE transport is required for Fly.io deployment
- Use mark3labs/mcp-go SDK (not official one)

## Technical Debt
- Only one tool implemented ("hello")
- No authentication mechanism
- No resource/prompt support
- Tests only cover basic scenarios
- Scripts are bash-only (not Windows-friendly)

*This session focused on testing infrastructure. The next session can build on this solid foundation to add more MCP capabilities.*
