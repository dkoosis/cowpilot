## New Organization

All test scripts are now in: `scripts/test/`

Features:
- Consistent formatting across all tests
- Color-coded output (green=pass, red=fail, yellow=warning, blue=info)
- Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- Test runner script (`run-tests.sh`) for easy execution
- README documentation

## Usage

```bash
cd scripts/test

# View all available tests
./run-tests.sh

# Run specific test by number
./run-tests.sh 1

# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh all

# Run quick smoke tests
./run-tests.sh quick
```

## Backup

Old scripts have been moved to `.old-test-scripts/` for reference.
