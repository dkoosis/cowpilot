Here is the Go code documentation enhancement report, created by applying the "Q05 Go Code Documentation Enhancement" prompt to the `internal/mcp/server.go` file from your codebase.

# üßê Go Code Documentation Enhancement Report

## 1\. File Under Review

  * **File Path**: `internal/mcp/server.go`
  * **Primary Purpose**: Implements the core MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, handling tool requests and managing server state.

## 2\. Overall Docstring Quality Assessment

  * **Coverage**: **Medium**. Most functions have comments, but they are informal and lack the structured `godoc` format. Key components like the `Server` struct are undocumented.
  * **Clarity**: **High**. The existing comments are clear and easy to understand.
  * **Actionability**: **Medium**. The comments explain *what* the code does, but they do not consistently explain the *purpose* of parameters or the nature of return values, which is crucial for new developers.

## 3\. Docstring Quality Metrics

| Metric | Score | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completeness** | 2/5 | Key structs and several functions are missing formal `godoc` comments. |
| **Clarity** | 4/5 | Existing comments are well-written and easy to understand. |
| **Idiomatic Style** | 1/5 | The code does not use the standard `godoc` format for comments. |

## 4\. Enhanced Documentation Block

Below is the enhanced documentation for the `Server` struct and the `NewServer` function from `internal/mcp/server.go`.

```go
// Server represents the core MCP server instance. It holds the server's
// configuration, manages the list of available tools, and tracks the server's
// operational state.
type Server struct {
	// Name is the identifier for the server, used in logs and responses.
	Name string
	// Tools is a map of tool names to their corresponding MCP tool definitions.
	Tools map[string]mcp.Tool
	// Started is a timestamp indicating when the server was initialized.
	Started time.Time
}

// NewServer creates and initializes a new MCP Server instance.
// It sets up the server with a default name, initializes the tool map,
// and records the startup time. This function is the primary entry point
for creating a functional MCP server.
//
// Returns:
//   - A pointer to the newly created Server instance.
func NewServer() *Server {
	// ... function body
}
```

## 5\. Specific Recommendations for `internal/mcp/server.go`

1.  **Document the `Server` struct**: Add a `godoc` comment block explaining the purpose of the `Server` struct and each of its fields (`Name`, `Tools`, `Started`). This is critical for anyone trying to understand the server's state.
2.  **Standardize `NewServer` Docs**: Convert the existing comment for `NewServer` into the standard `godoc` format. Clearly state what it does and what it returns.
3.  **Document `ListTools`**: Add a `godoc` comment explaining that the function returns a list of available tool specifications.
4.  **Document `HandleToolRequest`**: This is the most complex function and requires a detailed `godoc` block.
      * Explain its primary purpose: to execute a tool based on a request.
      * Document the `req` parameter: `// req - The incoming tool request from the client.`
      * Document the `w` parameter: `// w - The writer to stream tool output back to the client.`
      * Document the return value: `// Returns: An error if the tool is not found or if execution fails.`

By implementing these changes, the documentation for `server.go` will be significantly more robust, idiomatic, and useful for both new and existing developers on the project.
