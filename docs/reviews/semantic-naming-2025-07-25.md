Of course. Now that I have access to the full repository contents, I can proceed with the detailed analysis as you requested.

Here is the completed semantic naming and conceptual grouping analysis for the `cowpilot` project.

# üßê Semantic Naming & Conceptual Grouping Analysis

## ‚ú® Actionable Recommendations (Prioritized)

The project exhibits a very high degree of semantic clarity and structural cohesion. The package organization is logical and follows best practices, making the codebase easy to navigate and understand. The following are minor suggestions for potential improvement.

* **üü° Medium Priority:**
    * **Suggestion 1:** Consider renaming the `internal/resources` package to something more specific, such as `internal/resourcestore` or `internal/resourceprovider`.
        * **Rationale:** While `resources` is clear, it's a very common and somewhat generic noun. A more specific name could better describe the package's role in *managing* or *providing* resources, distinguishing it from the resources themselves. This is a minor point as the current context makes it understandable.

## üî¨ Detailed Findings

### üì¶ Package Conceptual Domains

Based on the directory names and their contents, the primary conceptual domains are:

* **`cmd/cowpilot`**: **Application Entrypoint**. Serves as the main executable entry point, responsible for application initialization and startup.
* **`internal/mcp`**: **MCP Protocol Handling**. Manages the core logic for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including server implementation, protocol definitions, and specification handling.
* **`internal/transport`**: **Transport Layer (HTTP/SSE)**. Implements the HTTP/SSE server, handling how the MCP server communicates with clients.
* **`internal/tools`**: **Tool Implementations**. A collection of distinct, self-contained tool functionalities that can be invoked through the MCP server (e.g., `echo`, `add`, `get_time`).
* **`internal/resources`**: **Resource Management**. Handles the loading and serving of defined application resources like text and images.

### ü§î Semantic Naming Issues

* **Ambiguous Names:** None flagged. All file and package names are clear within their respective contexts.
* **Generic Names:**
    * `internal/resources`: This name is slightly generic. While its purpose is clear from the project's context, it could be more descriptive of its function (e.g., `resourcestore`, `resourceprovider`) to further enhance clarity.

### üîó Structural Cohesion & Consistency Issues

* **Directory Cohesion Assessment:** The project demonstrates excellent cohesion across all analyzed directories. Each package contains files and sub-directories that are tightly aligned with its stated conceptual domain.

| Directory Path | Primary Domain | Detected Concepts Within | Cohesion Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cmd/cowpilot` | Application Entrypoint | Application Entrypoint | High |
| `internal/mcp` | MCP Protocol Handling | MCP Protocol Handling | High |
| `internal/transport`| Transport Layer (HTTP/SSE) | Transport Layer (HTTP/SSE) | High |
| `internal/tools` | Tool Implementations | Tool Implementations | High |
| `internal/resources`| Resource Management | Resource Management | High |

* **Terminology Inconsistencies:** None were identified. The terminology used for core concepts like "MCP," "transport," "tools," and "resources" is consistent across the entire codebase.

### üìù Qualitative Summary

Overall, the `cowpilot` project is a strong example of clear semantic naming and high conceptual cohesion. The project is structured as a collection of well-defined, single-responsibility packages. This clean separation of concerns‚Äîentrypoint, protocol logic, transport layer, tools, and resources‚Äîresults in a codebase that is easy to reason about, maintain, and extend. The single flagged generic name is a minor point in an otherwise exceptionally well-structured project.
