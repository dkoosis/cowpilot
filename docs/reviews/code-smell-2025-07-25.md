## 2. Prioritized Findings

*(Issues are listed from most to least severe.)*

### ⚪ P3 - Low (Dispensables)

* **File**: `internal/tools/base64.go`, `internal/tools/string.go`
* **Location**: `base64Encode` / `base64Decode` and `stringOperation` struct definitions and initializations.
* **Smell**: Duplicated Code
* **Finding**: The structure for defining a tool (the `mcp.Tool` struct containing `Name`, `Description`, `Arguments`, etc.) is repeated with very similar boilerplate code in each file within the `internal/tools` directory. While each tool is unique, the structural setup is nearly identical.
* **Recommendation**: This is a very minor smell and largely acceptable for clarity and simplicity. However, to reduce boilerplate, consider creating a generic "tool factory" or builder function. A function like `NewTool(name, description, args, handler)` could centralize the creation of these tool structs, reducing the repetitive code in each file and ensuring consistency. Given the small number of tools, the current approach remains highly maintainable.
