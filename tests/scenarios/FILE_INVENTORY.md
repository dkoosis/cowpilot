## Total: 16 files created/modified

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Setup
./tests/e2e/quick-setup.sh

# Run Inspector tests
make e2e-test-prod

# Run raw SSE tests  
make e2e-test-raw

# Run all E2E tests
make e2e-test-prod && make e2e-test-raw
```

### Key Achievement
Successfully implemented two complementary testing approaches:
1. **High-level**: Official MCP Inspector for standard compliance
2. **Low-level**: Raw curl/jq for protocol debugging

Both approaches are production-ready, well-documented, and integrated with the build system.
