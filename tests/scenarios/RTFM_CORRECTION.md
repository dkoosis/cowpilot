# RTFM Correction Summary

You were absolutely right - I did NOT properly read the MCP Inspector documentation before implementing the tests. Here's what I corrected:

## What I Got Wrong Initially

1. **Command Name**: Used `mcp-inspector-cli` instead of `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
2. **CLI Flag**: Didn't use the required `--cli` flag
3. **Method Invocation**: Tried to pass raw JSON-RPC instead of using `--method` flags
4. **Tool Arguments**: Didn't know about `--tool-name` and `--tool-arg` flags
5. **Transport**: Didn't realize SSE is the default for HTTP(S) URLs

## Corrected Implementation

The test suite now properly uses the MCP Inspector CLI:

```bash
# Correct usage examples:
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://mcp-adapters.fly.dev/ --method tools/list
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://mcp-adapters.fly.dev/ --method tools/call --tool-name hello
```

## Files Updated

1. **mcp_scenarios.sh** - Complete rewrite to use proper CLI syntax
2. **e2e_test.go** - Updated to check for correct tool availability
3. **README.md** - Fixed references and troubleshooting
4. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Added correction notice

## New Files Added

1. **verify-inspector.sh** - Quick check for proper installation
2. **manual-test-examples.sh** - Shows correct CLI usage examples

## Lesson Learned

Always RTFM before implementing! The MCP Inspector has a specific CLI interface that must be used correctly. My initial implementation would have failed completely because I was trying to use it like a generic JSON-RPC client instead of using its proper command structure.

Thank you for catching this - it's a critical fix that makes the tests actually functional!
